This project implements and evaluates multiple boosting models to predict credit default risks based on a credit card dataset. Using advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the models optimize performance metrics such as ROC AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall. The final workflow is designed to provide insights into the factors influencing credit defaults, enhancing decision-making for financial institutions. This comprehensive analysis showcases the effectiveness of boosting algorithms in a practical financial context.
